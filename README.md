UTM code shortener simplifies the process of measuring the ROI of Paid Organic campaigns, thereby improving its measurement accuracy.

A typical example of Paid Organic is a viral campaign through Naver Power Bloggers.
Since these campaigns have to go through multiple delivery steps, complex and long UTM URL should take the risk of being damaged or altered during delivery.

However, 
after years of empirical testing, we have found that URLs of a very simple form, such as the one below, are not at risk of being corrupted or altered during transmission.

When the UTM code of a Paid Organic campaign is assigned correctly, the following effects can be achieved.

### 1. Measure Campaign Performance

UTM codes are added to the end of your URLs to track and measure the performance of your online marketing campaigns.
This allows you to see where traffic to your website is coming from, how it is arriving, and why it is being visited.

### 2. Detailed Analysis Possible

UTM codes allow you to analyze the source of your traffic in detail, including five types of parameters.
For example, you can clearly see which marketing strategies are effective through campaign source, medium, name, etc.

### 3. Efficient Resource Allocation

This data allows you to identify which campaigns are generating the highest ROI (return on investment).
This provides an opportunity to allocate your marketing budget more efficiently and focus on effective strategies.

### 4. Optimize your campaigns for success

UTM codes allow you to continuously monitor and analyze the performance of your campaigns.
This allows you to optimize your marketing efforts and achieve better results.

### 5. Promotes Business Growth

Ultimately, UTM codes contribute to business growth. They help you achieve your business goals by understanding customer behavior and figuring out effective marketing strategies.
